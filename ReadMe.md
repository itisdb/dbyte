## **Things to Do**
--------------------------------
- Create a FastAPI with vercel ❌ -> this doesnt work as for normal serverless functions it has a file limit for 3MB and the calling time for the function needs to be low. Which is problematic when we are going for any AI model as well.
- Need to look for a better way to host this freely. Options are below:
    - cyclic.sh
    - railway.app
    - render.com
- API endpoints to create
    - Images to PDf
    - PDF to images
    - Mass Image translate using the Google Lens API
- Create a website for easy acces on Vercel
- Create a link between them as moving from one to another
