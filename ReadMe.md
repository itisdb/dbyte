Create a FastAPI with vercel ❌ -> this doesnt work as for normal serverless functions it has a file limit for 3MB and the calling time for the function needs to be low. Which is problematic when we are going for any AI model as well.

FastAPIs are working correctly. Need to look in the hosting options.

Need to look for a better way to host this freely. Options are below:

- ~~ ~~ vercel.com ❌~~~~
- ~~ ~~ cyclic.sh ❌ > this has shut dwn and doesnt work~~~~
- ~~ railway.app ❌ > this provides less options~~

API endpoints to create

- [X] PDF2Image
- [X] Images to PDf
- [ ] Mass Image translate using the Google Lens API
- [ ] Create a chat socket(any live socket). Live socket learning
- [ ] Create a stream feature where we can stream a movie.
- [ ] New Encoding and Decoding Techniques natively rather than any other package using python

Create a website for easy acces on Vercel

Create a link between them as moving from one to another
