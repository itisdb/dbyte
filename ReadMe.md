## **Things to Do**

Create a FastAPI with vercel ❌ -> this doesnt work as for normal serverless functions it has a file limit for 3MB and the calling time for the function needs to be low. Which is problematic when we are going for any AI model as well.

Need to look for a better way to host this freely. Options are below:

- [X] cyclic.sh ❌ > this has shut dwn and doesnt work
- [X] railway.app
- [X] render.com

API endpoints to create

- [X] PDF2Image
- [X] Images to PDf
- [ ] Mass Image translate using the Google Lens API

Create a website for easy acces on Vercel

Create a link between them as moving from one to another
